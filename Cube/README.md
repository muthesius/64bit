## Compile Firmware

The firmware can be compiled using the Arduino IDE. Please make sure you have the following platforms and libraries installed:

* esp8266 **version 2.3.0!!** (install through the board manager by following the instruction in the README here https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
* i2cdevlib (for installation see https://www.i2cdevlib.com/usage ) 
* PubSub Client (through the library manager)


## Setup Board Type

Select the `Wemos D1 R2 & mini` from the board menu. Make sure you have the driver installed (see below).

## OSX Driver Installation

For the Wemos you need to install the serial driver on OSX. Here is a good tutorial on how to get up and running: https://blog.rjdlee.com/getting-started-with-wemos-d1-on-mac-osx/
